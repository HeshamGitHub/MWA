why we do want sometimes use setImmediate vs setTimeOut?

SetImmediate callback is enqueued at Check Queue however SetTimeOut callback is enqueued at the Timer Queue,
Once the required time is passed,based on the event looping thread current tick state it will decide which we one should be executed first,
knowing that timers callback queue Precedes check queue.


Explain difference between Process.nextTick and setImmediate?

Process nextTick is enqueuing callback directly to the nextTick queue and setImmediate enqueue at check Queue however that
nextTick queue call backs execution is always Precedes check queue.
